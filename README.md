#About:

Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully landed Chandrayaan-3 Vikram on the lunar surface and Pragyan explored near to the southern pole of the Moon. Post this accomplishment, it is time to look at future robotic exploration missions to the Moon and other planetary bodies. It has been a constant endeavour at ISRO that, we create unique opportunities for academia & industry to participate in the technology developmental activities commensurate with organisational objectives. In line with these objectives, U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC) solicits from the youth of India, innovative ideas and designs of robotic rovers for future missions through the conduct of IRoC-U. The objective here is to provide development opportunities in space robotics to the participating entities and to leverage the creative thinking among the youth of our Nation for ISRO interplanetary missions. It is also expected to play an important role in augmenting ISROâ€™s activities in space exploration.

All interested are encouraged to participate in this challenging competition and join hands with ISRO, towards the advancement of space science & technology in the country

Objectives of the Challenge :

To provide a standardised platform for exploring the area of space robotics

To develop a deeper understanding of space robotics and its applications among the student community. It enhances their communication, collaboration, inquiry, problem solving and flexibility skills that will benefit them in their academic and professional lives.

To co-develop (students and ISRO) future technologies needed in the area of space robotics.
